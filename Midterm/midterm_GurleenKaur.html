            <h3>You Attract What You Are.</h3>

            <p>Spirituality is often misinterpreted as a pseudo-science or a form of “magic” that doesn’t exist in reality since it is not noticeable to the naked eye. Not only does this take away an individual’s exploration of their own sense of belief, but it also gives a sense of ignorance to the topic as a whole. However, through many up and coming techniques that have proven to be true, I believe there is a link between science and spirituality that many over look.</p>
            <p class="blueText">Looking at one of the most popular ways in which spirituality has overtaken the internet is through manifesting; which is the new age way of saying the law of attraction. The law of attraction does have a science behind it since humans are very much energy fields themselves. All matter and psychological processs such as thoughts and emotions are composed of energy. Us as humans are constantly spewing energy and each emotion we are feeling actually creates a specific wavelength in which we carry out in our energy field. If the emotion you are feeling is apathy or lethargy, that frequency of that wavelength will carry out into your current atmosphere, hence attracting anything or anyone with those same feelings or emotions. </p>
            <p>Although there are a lot of misconceptions around the word manfiesting, it is still a beneficial way to manipulate or transform your mind into thinking and carrying out your innermost and deepest desires.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>


            <p>It has become increasingly more popular to distinguish between spirituality and religion. Spirituality is known as the experience or exploration of one's own perspective on these beliefs while religion already holds a lot of principles and rules that cannot be changed. </p>

            <p>Signs of spirituality were seen with the Neanderthals. As human beings started to evolve, we became more aware of what beliefs we do consider spiritual now.</p>
